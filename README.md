# UST Test 

## List of scripts:

1. Program_1.py
2. Program_2.py
3. main_1.py
4. main_2.py
5. main_test.py
6. multithreading.py
7. unittest.py  
### Modules
1. divisible.py
2. Interleave.py 

*  program 1 and 2 explains the logic for the following question
   * Write a function using a generator to print the numbers which can be divisible by 5 and 7 between 0 and given number n  in comma separated form. 
      ○	E.g - given number = 100 . output = 0,35,70
   * Write a function that interleaves 2 strings. 
      ○	e.g.  string_1=AAAA,  string_2=1234567 -> output (interleaved_string) = A1A2A3A4567
* modules divisible.py and Interleave.py which has the algorithm logic
* Main 1/2 and data.json are the source files for multithreading
* Unittesting.py test the logic on main files (algorithms)
